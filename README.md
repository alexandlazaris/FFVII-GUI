## findings

- use Containers to colour widget areas on screen, use these coloured boxes to help shape & size your layout easily. Once you have your layout as desired across mobile/desktop,then replace with your real widgets
- split up widgets that are reusable, make modular widgets but also keep widgets specific. Not everything has to be a single, atomic entity
- test on real device, don't trust simulator
- ~~enable internet permissions for Mac, android, ios apps~~
- ~~enable CORS on API server~~
- a black icon app was having different effects on android
